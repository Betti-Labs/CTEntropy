## Abstract

**Background:** Traditional electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis relies primarily on frequency-domain decomposition and visual pattern recognition, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and cross-condition applicability. Information-theoretic approaches offer alternative perspectives on neural signal complexity but have not been systematically applied to multi-condition neurological diagnostics.

**Methods:** We developed CTEntropy, a computational framework implementing symbolic entropy analysis of EEG signals through Fast Fourier Transform-based spectral decomposition and sliding window entropy calculation. The methodology transforms continuous neural signals into symbolic representations, enabling Shannon entropy quantification of neural complexity. We validated the approach across three public datasets: PhysioNet EEG Motor Movement Dataset (109 healthy subjects), CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database (24 pediatric epilepsy patients), and UCI EEG Database (122 subjects with alcohol use disorder).

**Results:** Symbolic entropy analysis revealed statistically significant differences between neurological conditions and healthy controls. Epilepsy patients demonstrated reduced entropy compared to healthy subjects (3.312 ± 0.140 vs 3.785 ± 0.129, p < 0.000001, Cohen's d = 3.394). Machine learning classification of alcohol use disorder achieved 86.7% accuracy using entropy features. Individual entropy signatures showed consistent within-subject patterns across recording sessions.

**Conclusions:** Symbolic entropy analysis provides a novel methodological approach to neurological signal analysis, offering advantages over traditional frequency-domain methods through unified multi-condition detection capabilities and individual entropy profiling. The framework demonstrates potential for advancing precision medicine approaches in neurological diagnostics.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Limitations of Current EEG Analysis Methods

Contemporary electroencephalographic analysis predominantly employs frequency-domain decomposition, dividing neural signals into predefined frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) for power spectral analysis [1,2]. While this approach has proven valuable for specific applications, it presents several methodological limitations:

**1. Linear Assumptions:** Traditional spectral analysis assumes linear signal properties, potentially missing non-linear neural dynamics characteristic of pathological conditions [3].

**2. Fixed Frequency Bands:** Predefined frequency ranges may not capture individual variations in neural oscillations or condition-specific spectral patterns [4].

**3. Population-Based Statistics:** Group-level statistical comparisons may obscure individual differences critical for personalized medicine approaches [5].

**4. Condition-Specific Protocols:** Different neurological conditions typically require separate analytical pipelines, limiting cross-condition comparative studies [6].

### 1.2 Information-Theoretic Approaches to Neural Signal Analysis

Information theory, originally developed by Shannon for communication systems [7], provides mathematical frameworks for quantifying signal complexity and predictability. Applied to neural signals, entropy measures can capture:

- **Signal Complexity:** Higher entropy indicates more complex, less predictable neural patterns
- **Information Content:** Quantification of information-carrying capacity in neural communications
- **Dynamic Range:** Measurement of variability in neural state transitions
- **Temporal Structure:** Characterization of patterns in neural signal organization

Previous applications of entropy measures to EEG analysis have shown promise in specific contexts [8,9], but systematic multi-condition validation and methodological standardization remain limited.

### 1.3 Methodological Innovation: Symbolic Entropy Framework

CTEntropy introduces several methodological innovations that distinguish it from existing approaches:

**1. Symbolic Transformation:** Continuous EEG signals are transformed into symbolic representations through spectral decomposition, enabling entropy calculation that captures non-linear dynamics while maintaining computational efficiency.

**2. Multi-Scale Analysis:** Sliding window implementation across multiple temporal scales (10ms to 100ms) captures both rapid neural events and slower dynamic changes within a unified analytical framework.

**3. Individual Entropy Signatures:** Rather than relying solely on population statistics, the framework develops personalized neural complexity profiles that may reveal subtle individual differences.

**4. Cross-Condition Detection:** A single analytical pipeline capable of detecting multiple neurological conditions, enabling comparative studies and unified screening approaches.

### 1.4 Research Objectives

This study aims to:

1. **Validate Methodology:** Demonstrate the effectiveness of symbolic entropy analysis across multiple neurological conditions using public datasets
2. **Establish Statistical Significance:** Quantify entropy differences between neurological conditions and healthy controls with appropriate statistical validation
3. **Develop Classification Framework:** Implement machine learning approaches for entropy-based condition classification
4. **Provide Open Research Tools:** Create reproducible, open-source platform for community validation and extension

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Symbolic Entropy Calculation

#### 2.1.1 Theoretical Foundation

The CTEntropy framework applies Shannon entropy principles to neural signal analysis:

```
H(X) = -Σ p(xi) log₂ p(xi)
```

where X represents the symbolic representation of the neural signal, and p(xi) denotes the probability of symbol xi occurring in the sequence.

#### 2.1.2 Signal Transformation Algorithm

**Step 1: Windowing**
EEG signals are segmented using sliding windows with configurable size (default: 50 samples) and overlap (default: 50%):

```python
def sliding_window(signal, window_size, step_size):
    windows = []
    for i in range(0, len(signal) - window_size + 1, step_size):
        windows.append(signal[i:i + window_size])
    return windows
```

**Step 2: Spectral Decomposition**
Each window undergoes Fast Fourier Transform to obtain frequency domain representation:

```python
def spectral_transform(window):
    spectrum = np.abs(fft(window))
    # Use positive frequencies only
    spectrum = spectrum[:len(spectrum)//2]
    return spectrum
```

**Step 3: Normalization**
Spectral components are normalized to create probability distributions:

```python
def normalize_spectrum(spectrum):
    total_power = np.sum(spectrum)
    if total_power > 0:
        return spectrum / total_power
    else:
        return np.ones_like(spectrum) / len(spectrum)
```

**Step 4: Entropy Calculation**
Shannon entropy is computed for each normalized spectrum:

```python
def calculate_entropy(probability_distribution):
    # Remove zero probabilities to avoid log(0)
    p_nonzero = probability_distribution[probability_distribution > 0]
    return -np.sum(p_nonzero * np.log2(p_nonzero))
```

#### 2.1.3 Multi-Scale Implementation

To capture temporal dynamics across different scales, entropy is calculated using multiple window sizes:

- **Fine Scale (25 samples):** Captures rapid neural events and high-frequency dynamics
- **Medium Scale (50 samples):** Balances temporal resolution with statistical stability  
- **Coarse Scale (100 samples):** Reveals slower neural processes and long-range dependencies
