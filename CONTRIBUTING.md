## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CTEntropy.git
   cd CTEntropy
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .  # Install in development mode
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   python test_real_detection.py
   ```

### Development Guidelines

**Code Style**
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Add type hints where appropriate

**Testing**
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Test on multiple datasets when possible

**Documentation**
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Include examples in docstrings
- Update the whitepaper for methodological changes

## Contribution Process

### 1. Issue Discussion
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Discuss major changes in issues before implementation
- Use issue templates for bug reports and feature requests

### 2. Development
- Create a feature branch from main: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
- Make focused commits with clear messages
- Keep changes as small and focused as possible

### 3. Testing
- Run the full test suite: `python -m pytest tests/`
- Test on real data: `python validate_clinical_system.py`
- Verify documentation builds correctly

### 4. Pull Request
- Create a pull request with a clear description
- Reference related issues in the PR description
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

## Research Collaboration

### Dataset Contributions
We welcome validation on new datasets:

**Requirements:**
- Publicly available or ethically approved datasets
- Clear documentation of data characteristics
- Validation results with statistical analysis
- Comparison with existing results

**Process:**
1. Create an issue describing the dataset
2. Implement data loader following existing patterns
3. Run validation analysis
4. Submit results with statistical validation

### Methodological Extensions
For new entropy methods or analysis techniques:

**Requirements:**
- Theoretical justification for the method
- Implementation following existing code patterns
- Validation on multiple datasets
- Comparison with existing methods

**Process:**
1. Discuss the method in an issue
2. Implement following the existing architecture
3. Validate on standard datasets
4. Document the method thoroughly

## Code Architecture

### Core Components
- `ctentropy_platform/core/entropy.py`: Core entropy calculation algorithms
- `ctentropy_platform/core/signals.py`: Signal generation and preprocessing
