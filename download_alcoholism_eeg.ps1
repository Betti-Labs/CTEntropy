## Known Sources:
1. **UCI Machine Learning Repository**
   - EEG Database for Alcoholism
   - 122 subjects (77 alcoholic, 45 control)
   - URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Database

2. **PhysioNet Alternatives**
   - May have alcoholism-related studies
   - Check: https://physionet.org/content/

3. **Research Papers with Data**
   - Look for published studies with available datasets
   - Contact authors for data access

## Next Steps:
1. Research proper download method for UCI dataset
2. Check PhysioNet for similar datasets  
3. Look for published papers with available data
4. Consider synthetic alcoholism patterns based on research

## Hypothesis for Alcoholism Detection:
- Chronic alcohol use may alter neural complexity
- Expect different entropy patterns in alcoholic vs control subjects
- Could enable early addiction screening
