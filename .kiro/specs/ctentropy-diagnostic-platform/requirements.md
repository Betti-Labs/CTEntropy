# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CTEntropy Diagnostic Platform is a clinical-grade system that leverages symbolic entropy analysis and PCA fingerprinting to detect early neurological degeneration from EEG and MRI data. The platform transforms research-proven entropy collapse patterns into a deployable diagnostic tool for healthcare providers, enabling non-invasive early detection of conditions like CTE, Alzheimer's disease, and depression without requiring invasive procedures or extensive behavioral testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-World Data Integration

2. WHEN artifacts are detected THEN the system SHALL offer automatic and manual artifact removal options
3. WHEN signals contain noise THEN the system SHALL apply adaptive denoising algorithms
4. WHEN preprocessing is complete THEN the system SHALL allow users to compare before/after signal quality

### Requirement 4: PCA Fingerprinting and Classification

**User Story:** As a clinician, I want automated pattern recognition that can identify neurological conditions so that I can receive diagnostic insights without manual interpretation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PCA analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL generate multi-dimensional neuro-fingerprints
2. WHEN baseline training data exists THEN the system SHALL train classifiers for known conditions (CTE, Alzheimer's, depression)
3. WHEN new patient data is analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide risk scores and confidence intervals
4. WHEN classification results are generated THEN the system SHALL highlight key distinguishing features
5. IF multiple conditions are possible THEN the system SHALL rank differential diagnoses by probability
6. WHEN fingerprints are visualized THEN the system SHALL provide interactive 2D/3D scatter plots with condition clustering

### Requirement 5: Clinical-Grade Reporting System

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want comprehensive diagnostic reports so that I can make informed clinical decisions and share results with patients and colleagues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate PDF reports with executive summaries
2. WHEN reports are created THEN the system SHALL include entropy trends, PCA visualizations, and risk assessments
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support CSV format for further analysis
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include methodology explanations and confidence metrics
5. IF longitudinal data exists THEN the system SHALL show progression tracking over time
6. WHEN sharing reports THEN the system SHALL ensure HIPAA compliance and data anonymization options

### Requirement 6: Interactive Web Dashboard

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive web interface so that I can easily upload data, configure analysis, and view results without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the platform THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, responsive web interface
2. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop functionality with progress bars
3. WHEN configuring analysis THEN the system SHALL provide guided workflows with parameter explanations
4. WHEN results are ready THEN the system SHALL display interactive visualizations and downloadable reports
5. IF analysis is running THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress and allow job cancellation
6. WHEN multiple analyses exist THEN the system SHALL provide project management and history tracking

### Requirement 7: Model Validation and Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive validation metrics so that I can assess diagnostic accuracy and publish peer-reviewed results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate sensitivity, specificity, and AUC metrics
2. WHEN cross-validation is run THEN the system SHALL support k-fold and leave-one-out validation strategies
3. WHEN performance metrics are generated THEN the system SHALL provide confusion matrices and ROC curves
4. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL support statistical significance testing
